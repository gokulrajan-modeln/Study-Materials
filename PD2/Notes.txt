Using Salesforce Features with Apex: 
    Actions: 
    Create actions -  let users create records
    Custom actions - invoke Lightning components, flows, Visualforce pages, or canvas apps with  custom functionality    
    global custom actions - for tasks that donâ€™t require users to use records that have a relationship to a specific object.
    Object-specific custom actions - let users interact with or create records that have a relationship to an object record
    create, Log a Call, and custom actions, you can create either object-specific actions or global actions.
    Update actions must be object-specific.
